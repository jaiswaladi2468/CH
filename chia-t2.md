Recommendations for each of the questions:

1. **Deploying the Application's Infrastructure**:
   - Begin by setting up a separate environment for the new application, such as a new Kubernetes namespace or a separate AWS account (using AWS Organizations for isolation).

2. **CI/CD System**:
   - Consider using popular CI/CD systems like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions. Choose a system that integrates well with your chosen cloud platform and version control system.

3. **Hosting the Frontend**:
   - Host the frontend as a static website on a content delivery network (CDN) like AWS CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN, or a service like Netlify or Vercel for fast global delivery and responsiveness.

4. **Backend Architecture**:

    a. **Single Web Application**:
      - **Components/Cloud Services**: 
        - Node.js application hosted on a container service like AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, or a Kubernetes cluster.
        - API Gateway (like AWS API Gateway or Google Cloud Endpoints) for managing API access.
        - Serverless Functions (optional) for specific functionalities.
      - **Pros**:
        - Simpler deployment and maintenance.
        - Easier to manage authentication and authorization.
        - Centralized logging and monitoring.
      - **Cons**:
        - Potential for a larger codebase, which might become complex over time.

    b. **Individual Functions**:
      - **Components/Cloud Services**:
        - AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Azure Functions for each API endpoint.
        - API Gateway (for HTTP trigger) or Event-driven architecture (for other triggers).
      - **Pros**:
        - Easier to scale individual functions independently.
        - Potential for finer-grained control over resources.
        - Less potential for a monolithic codebase.
      - **Cons**:
        - More complex deployment and management of multiple functions.
        - Overhead of managing each function separately.

5. **Database Considerations**:
   - Ensure that the database is secure and encrypted at rest.
   - Implement proper access controls and encryption for sensitive data.
   - Consider using a managed database service (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) for easier management.

6. **Database Architecture**:
   - Use a reliable, scalable database service like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or a managed MySQL service.
   - Consider setting up a read replica or a standby instance for redundancy and failover.

7. **Deploying Schema Changes**:
   - Use database migration tools like Flyway or Liquibase to manage schema changes in a controlled and automated manner.
   - Apply changes in a staging environment first, run tests, and then promote to production.

8. **Monitoring for 99% Uptime**:
   - Monitor the following components:
     - **Application Health**: Use synthetic transactions or endpoint monitoring to ensure APIs are responsive.
     - **Infrastructure**: Monitor server/container health, resource utilization, and autoscaling events.
     - **Database**: Monitor database performance, connections, and replication lag.
     - **CDN**: Track CDN usage, cache hit ratios, and request/response times.
     - **Logs and Errors**: Set up centralized logging and monitor for critical errors or exceptions.
     - **Alerting and Notifications**: Ensure that alerts are set up for key metrics and incidents are escalated appropriately.

Remember to implement automated backups, disaster recovery plans, and perform load testing to ensure the application can handle peak loads without downtime.
